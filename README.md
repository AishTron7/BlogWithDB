# Daily Journal
A beautiful website where you can write articles/blogs. Besides the clean and simple UI, one of the key features of this website is that composing new articles automatically creates new pages for them (which can be accessed by clicking on Read More). Creating new articles can be done by clicking on compose button as well as adding '/compose' to the url and entering. The use of EJS with node.js has made it possible to bring consistent design accross every page without repeating the header & footer code.

This responsive website uses Mongo DB Atlas for its database needs as it stores the articles written by users and dynamically populates them on the home page. Hosting is done on heroku and you can visit the site [here.](https://bit.ly/aishblog)
